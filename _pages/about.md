## Professional Profile

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Forest and Landscape Ecology in 2022 from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. My research focuses on soil microbial ecology and biogeochemical cycles, with particular emphasis on microbial responses to climate change (e.g., elevated ozone, warming, and drought) and microbial regulation and feedbacks of the terrestrial carbon cycle under global change scenarios.

I have published multiple first-author papers in leading journals in soil and environmental ecology, including *Soil Biology and Biochemistry* (three papers, including one ESI Highly Cited Paper), *Functional Ecology* (ESI Highly Cited Paper), *Geoderma*, *Ecosystems*, and *Plant Ecology*. In total, I have authored or co-authored more than 20 SCI-indexed journal articles.
